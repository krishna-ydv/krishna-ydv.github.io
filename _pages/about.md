I am a third-year Undergraduate Computer Science student at [NIT Kurukshetra](https://nitkkr.ac.in/) India. I have nearly two years of research experience in the field of Machine Learning and Security. In the past, I have worked as a researcher supervised by [Dr.B.B Gupta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pxzB3EwAAAAJ&hl=ja), [Dr. Arcangelo Castiglione](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Uh1YyVYAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dr. Konstantinos Psannis](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=u7iiwdgAAAAJ&hl=en). I am broadly interested in the <strong>security and privacy aspect of centralized as well as federated machine learning</strong>. I am a founder of the [Security and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://saailab.github.io/) (<strong>SAI Lab</strong>), where I am leading a group of four research interns on Adversarial Machine Learning and Application-based Federated Machine Learning. I have also published papers at Journals like (<strong>Computer Communication-Elsevier</strong>) and conferences like (<strong>IEEE ICCE</strong>). 

I always strive to produce quality research work. I am a firm believer of "If you are doing something, then do it with all your effort; else don't do it at all." I will be graduating in May 2022, and<strong> I am effectively looking for a full-time role as a researcher in either Machine Learning or Security.</strong>

Adversarial examples are fabricated examples, indistinguishable from the original image that mislead neural networks and drastically lower their performance. Recently proposed AdvGAN, a GAN based approach, takes input image as a prior for generating adversaries to target a model. In this work, we show how latent features can serve as better priors than input images for adversary generation by proposing AdvGAN++, a version of AdvGAN that achieves higher attack rates than AdvGAN and at the same time generates perceptually realistic images on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
